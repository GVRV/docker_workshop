Docker architechture:
- Docker daemon: builds, runs, distribute containers
- Docker daemon runs on a host (needs LXC)
- Docker client: CLI, issues commands to daemon, communication via sockets or RESTful API
- Client / server architecture, communication over unix sockets or tcp, security via TLS


Docker Components:
- Docker images: a template to build containers like OOP classes
- Docker registries: place to hold images, Docker Hub is SasS offering for docker images,
it's like what Github is to code
- Docker containers: holds what is needed for an application to run, is isolated. Like instantiated objects

Typical Docker flow:
1. Pull image from registry
2. Creates the container from the pulled image
3. Allocate file system
4. Allocate network interface
5. Runs the process
6. Streams logs std output
