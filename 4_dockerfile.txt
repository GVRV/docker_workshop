Dockerfiles - file containing sets of commands to automatically build an image

Building image: docker build
- Build process is run by Docker daemon
- Daemon steps through and commits the result to the new image



- FROM {{image}} - sets base image

- RUN

    RUN <command> (always assumes /bin/sh -c)
    RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
    
    - Executes command in a new layer on top of the current image and commits
    - Like git commits, source control
    - Tips: chain as many commands

    FROM busybox
    RUN echo "test" > kogan.text

- CMD

    CMD <command> (always assumes /bin/sh -c)
    CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

    - Provide defaults for executing container
    - Executed when running the image
    - Does not get saved within the image
    - Does not execute at build time


- EXPOSE: defines which the container will listen on

- ENV key=value: sets env variables

- ADD {{src}} {{dest}}: adds file to filesystem of the container


- ENTRYPOINT
    
    ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

    - Configure container to run as an executable
